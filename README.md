# Overview
This is the place where I organized my study contents.

"arete" means "excellence" or "virtue" in Greek and Roman mythology, and refers to virtues that heroes and gods must achieve through hardship and training. It is an important concept, especially in ancient Greek culture, depicting the process of mythical figures demonstrating their abilities through trials and growing morally and spiritually.

I will use the word "arete" to code the process of studying and growing as a developer. :)
